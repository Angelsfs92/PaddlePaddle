The tutorials are written as Jupyter Notebooks and designed to be smoothly run on your machine. You should first install `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/install>`_ and `PaddleSpatial <../installation_guide.md>`_ before proceeding.

After the installation of Jupyter and PaddleSpatial, please go through the following steps:

#. 
    Clone this repository to your machine;
#. 
    Change the working directory of your shell to "path_to_your_repo/PaddleSpatial/tutorials/";
#. 
    Open "Jupyter lab" with the command ``jupyter-lab``\ , wait for your web browser to be called out;
#. 
    All the tutorials should be in the "File Browser" now.
