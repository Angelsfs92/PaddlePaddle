1. Dependencies should be installed using the following command before training:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Data description:
       Publicly available Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Taxi trip Data
   from  https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

       We provide the pre-processed toy dataset of 6 hours from 2019/4/13 8:00 a.m. to 2019/4/13 2:00 p.m.
   in ./data/NYC-taxi (2 hours per time step), including:
   ----train_data.npy   The OD flows of 3 time steps for training from Yellow Taxi records in sparse representation.
                        The sparse OD matrix of each time step is a [Index, Value] list.
                        Index = [(i_1,j_1),...,(i_k,j_k)], Value = [A_{i_1,j_1},...,A_{i_k,j_k}].
                        (70% of the whole existed OD pairs of Yellow Taxi)
   ----val_data.npy     The OD flows of the last time steps for validation.
                        (10% of the whole existed OD pairs of Yellow Taxi)
   ----test_data.npy    The OD flows of the last time steps for testing.
                        (20% of the whole existed OD pairs of Yellow Taxi)
   ----green_data.npy   The OD flows of 3 time steps for training from Green Taxi records

3. Here are commands for training the model on NYC Taxi.
   python train.py --data_path ./data/NYC-taxi

4. Evaluation.
   python eval.py --data_path ./data/NYC-taxi --checkpoints ./nyc/checkpoints
