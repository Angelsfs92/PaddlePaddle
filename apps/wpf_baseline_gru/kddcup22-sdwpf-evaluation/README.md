# Manual on Evaluation


## Environment Setup   

1. Operating system

    Ubuntu 18.04 

2. Python version

    python = 3.7

3. Packages installed in different environments

   1. [base](requirements/base_env_installed_packages.md)
   2. [paddlepaddle](requirements/paddlepaddle_env_installed_packages.md)
   3. [pytorch](requirements/pytorch_env_installed_packages.md)
   4. [tensorflow](requirements/tensorflow_env_installed_packages.md)



## Submitted Files

When the participants submit their developed code and model in a zip file, e.g. your-folder-name.zip, 
the extracted items should look like as follows: 

```
   ./your-folder-name
   | --- __init__.py         
   | --- predict.py           (required)
   | --- prepare.py           (required)
   | --- ... 
   | --- ./your-model-folder  (required)
   | --- ... 
```

In the extracted folder, 
one prediction-like script (e.g. the predict.py in the baseline code) is required.
In the prediction-like script, the forecast() interface should be implemented, 
and the forecast interface takes a dictionary that consists of a number of settings as the input parameter. 
And, another script named 'prepare.py' is required. 
Note that, the name of this script should be 'prepare.py'.
In the prepare.py script, the prep_env() interface is required to be implemented which will be invoked 
by the evaluation.py script (see the evaluation.py for more details). 

(UPDATE) ATTENTION: No parser is allowed in the prepare.py (please refer to the newly updated tests/test-1.zip), 
since it will conflict with the AIStudio eval_main() system call. 

In particular, the following arguments are required to be declared in 'prepare.py' for evaluation: 
   * checkpoints
   * pred_file
   * day_len
   * capacity
   * output_len
   * out_var
   * framework
   * is_debug


## Backend Files for Evaluation

Here, shown as below, we additionally demonstrate how the files are organized in the backend on the server side. 
This folder contains four sub-folders (i.e. './base', './paddlepaddle', './pytorch' and './tensorflow') and other sub-folders. 
In each sub-folder, evaluation.py, metrics.py and test_data.py are placed, which are currently released (please check for the latest updates in the [github](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSpatial/tree/main/apps/wpf_baseline_gru/kddcup22-sdwpf-evaluation/paddlepaddle)).
Besides, apt-requirements.txt and pip-requirements.txt are placed if necessary for different environments. 
If someone finds the environment (see [here](./requirements) for detailed specifications) does not support 
your model, please provide the detailed (apt/pip)-requirements.txt and contact the organizers ASAP.

   ./some-folder-name
